<br>
               It is the address used to access the resource address.The structure   of url is divided to three classes those are
<br>

1.Protocol<br>
2.Domain<br>
3.Path<br>
<b>1.Protocol:</b>
It is the set guidelines or rules helps us to display the data over the internet.There are different types in protocol mainly<br>
http<br>
https<br>
<b>2.Domain:</b>
Domain make it easy for users to access websites without needing to remember IP addresses.There are two types in Domain<br
Second Level Domain<br>
Top Level Domain<br>
<b>3.Path:</b>
The Path specifies the location of the resource on the server.

<h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
<br>
Agile Methodology is one most used method in developing of a project. It uses Sprint Method in division work to the developers like sprint1,sprint2..etc.for every sprint they will provide a time period.After every sprint the code is sent to the testing team,if testing team accept the code then it moves for sprint 2,else it sent to sprint1.There is a Scrum Call during the project,they will track the sprint details,clarify the developer queries and gives some instructions.The Scrum call is Managed by Scrum Master.The specialisation of this method is testing is done after every sprint unlike other methods that improves efficiency of the system.<br>
<h2>Waterfall Methodology</h2>
It is one of the project implementation method mostly opted for Smaller Projects.In this method the testing is done after the completion whole development.It is mostly used method followed by agile.

<br>
Software Development Life cycle is the process for Developing project.It consist several steps
<br><br>
<li><b>Requirement Analysis:</b>Identify and document the requirements.clients define project goals,scope.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Planning:</b>Plan for resources and analyse the budget.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Designing:</b>Create architecture and Design features of the system.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Implementation:</b>Developers write the code according to the design specifications.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Testing:</b>The software is tested to find bugs and also the user acceptance.</li><br>
<li><b>Deployment:</b>The system is made available for users.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Maintainance:</b>The system is monitored after the Deployment.</li>
<br>
<h2>Devops</h2>
<br>
<li>The Devops team will secure data Deployment through CI/CD Pipelines.</li>
<li>They will adjust the storage Requirement by upscaling and downscaling.</li>
<li>They ensure Maintainance of the project after development.</li>
